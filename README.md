# 2D RPG Adventure Game (A-Level Computer Science NEA)

This is my **Non-Exam Assessment (NEA) project** for A-Level Computer Science. It is a 2D browser-based RPG game written in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, featuring a tile-based world, sprite movement, and basic game mechanics.

The goal was to demonstrate key principles of software development including planning, design, implementation, and testing, while also creating a playable and engaging product.
